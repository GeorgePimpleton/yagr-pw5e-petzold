'Yet Another GitHub Repository' of revised C source code for Charles Petzold's Programming Windows 5th Edition ISBN-10 157231995X, adapting to the modern WinAPI

### Note
The original source code for Checker3 and Checker4 will compile only for x86, courtesy of the `GetWindowLong()` WinAPI function.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
